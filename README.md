# SHMUP
A single-stage spaceship shoot 'em up for 1-2 players with various weapons, enemies, and powerups. And highscore lists!

Made as an assignment for XAMK and CADGI's IVGC course, which also provided the art, music and SFX assets.

## Play
Download the .zip from BuildWin/ on your Windows device, extract, and run the executable!

## Some TODOs:
* More enemies & tougher boss
* Finalized stage graphics (rocks changing into big squares is not a design choice)
* working WebGL build
* more difficulty stages (only 1 currently)
* non-hardcoded Craft configs
